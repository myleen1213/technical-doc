            Dash type are different types of transportation methods a dasher can
            select to dash. DoorDash tries to fit the most suitable order types
            depending on your dash type. In most markets, you'll get the most
            orders if you dash with a car. In other markets that are more
            difficult to get around in a car, you might find certain areas are
            more favorable with a bike instead.
          </p>
          <br />
          <header>What dash types are available?</header>
          <ul>

            choose the right Dash type when you start your shift.</code>

          <header>Why do I need to choose the right Dash type</header>
          <p>
            Selecting the right dash type ensures that you are getting the right
            orders for your vehicle type which factors things like distance,
            weight, and size of the orders you get.
